# Welcome to Catamount Music!

### A little about us 

As passionate composers and musicians, we write in a variety of genres, including jazz, blues, ragtime, folk, and acoustic instruments. 
We write songs, cues, instrumentals, and other styles for publishers, film & TV, and music libraries.

### Why we are here

Dave's background is in high tech, reliability engineering in particular. So when we started Catamount Music, he realized we had a chance
to use GitHub and other tools in the business. We use GitHub to store branding, lyrics, songs, and other assets.

We also have a public repo cleverly named [public-domain](https://github.com/catamount-music/public-domain). 
This repo is where we put things that we wish to distribute unrestricted. It contains things we use day to day and things we write and blog about.
